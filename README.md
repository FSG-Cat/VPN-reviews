***Transparent, community-driven VPN tools.***

Companies and customers look for one-stop shops for privacy and anonymity, making VPNs an incredibly misunderstood tool.

As of February 5, 2022 we have decided to end our review protocol and instead let the data for each service speak for itself.

## How to Contribute
#### VPN Chart
Our VPN Chart is open source and we want every VPN on it. To make this possible, we encourage individuals (or even VPN companies) to:
* Look for mistakes, please find & report them!
* Add missing data
* Add new services

The chart is in a CSV format. It's recommended to copy/paste the header row and go through each column to fill in the necessary data. Feel free to refer to other VPNs for help. If you don't know what something means, just leave it blank! You can submit just a single data point if you wanted--this is a community project. The chart will improve with time to be more intuitive and easier to use. We thank our early contributors in dealing with its limitations.

#### Spread the Word
There aren't many legitimate VPN resources on the internet. In fact, many resources pay huge sums of money for SEO to outrank legitimate resources. To help combat this, we ask users to share this project as much as possible. Word of mouth is how we rely on spreading this project to as many people as possible.

## Affiliate Plans & Sponsorships
*This readme is brought to you buy NordVPN...* ***NOT***

Sponsorships can be fine, but they've led to massive amounts of misinformation, fake and/or biased reviews, & other...questionable practices.


***We have not and will never be sponsored by a VPN provider. Period.***


Because services are reviewed systematically, we are able to set transparant affiliate standards:
**Note: As of February 5, 2022 our review protocol is being phased out. We are still deciding how to migrate affiliate standards going forward without a review protocol. Keep an eye out for updates.**
* Our first requirement is a minimum score of 4.20/5 in the [review protocol.](https://github.com/techlore/VPN-reviews/blob/master/protocol.md) If a VPN scores any less, we are unable to offer an affiliate link. This is a standard we set for ourselves, and this requirement has no effect on the testing of a service.
* Affiliate plans are never considered during testing, and services without an affiliate plan are equally likely to perform the same as a non-affiliate service.
* Affiliate plans are never hidden. We include both a standard link and an affiliate link in our reviews, clearly labeled. If a user doesn't want to support us--they have the ***choice*** not to. 
* Even if a VPN scores 4.20/5 or higher, it must also pass our standard channel [affiliate requirements found here.](https://github.com/techlore/YT-channel/blob/master/affiliates.md)
* If all safeguards fail, we hold ever right to cancel affiliate plans we deem to violate community trust. 

## Do I Need a VPN? 
Depends on your use-case, threat model, and what youâ€™re trying to gain. We recommend the following resources covering VPNs and their use case:

* ['Do I Need a VPN?' Quiz](https://www.doineedavpn.com/)
* [IVPN's *Why you don't need a VPN*](https://www.ivpn.net/blog/why-you-dont-need-a-vpn/)
* [PrivacyGuides VPN Breakdown](https://www.privacyguides.org/providers/vpn/#info)

## Are You a VPN Provider? (FAQ)
### 'We Can Offer You...'
We don't care about affiliate rates (or if you have one at all) to get your service on the chart. Invest your time into contributing your data to the chart instead, it's open source and the only reason your service isn't there is because no one has submitted the data.

### 'We want to sponsor a...'
We don't accept any form of VPN sponsors on our videos. [View more information here.](https://github.com/techlore/VPN-reviews#affiliate-plans--sponsorships)

### 'So How Do I Get a Review?'
We generally don't do individual reviews of VPNs anymore. If something intrigues us enough that we feel deserves a review, it will be considered. But VPNs are pretty simple tools that don't generally need dedicated reviews anymore.
