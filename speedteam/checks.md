# Welcome to the Techlore SpeedTeam V3 Virtual Machine!

## For Your First Boot
- Is the VM working properly?
- What network adapter are you using? It should be bridged, not NAT.
- What are your speeds in your host computer vs the virtual machine? If speeds are more than a 20% difference, do not proceed. You can test this with a basic speed test (No VPNs needed)
- If all checks passed, continue with the instructions. The next step is scheduling your day for testing by email. **DO NOT** register for a day if you encountered an issue with a check, you should reach back out by email instead with your issue(s).

## For Future Boots & Speed Testing
- Are you still using the bridged network adapter?
- Are you not connected to any VPNs on your Host OS?
- Is there minimal network activity on both the Host OS as well as other devices on your network?
